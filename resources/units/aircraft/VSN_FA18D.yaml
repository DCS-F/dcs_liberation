description:
  "The F/A-18D Hornet is twin engine, supersonic fighter. The D-model can be configured
  for training or as an all-weather strike craft. The 'missionized' D model's rear seat
  is configured for a Marine Corps Naval Flight Officer who functions as a Weapons and
  Sensors Officer to assist in operating the weapons systems. The F/A-18D is primarily
  operated by the U.S. Marine Corps in the night attack and Forward Air Controller
  (Airborne) (FAC(A)) roles. The Finnish Air Force F/A-18Ds are also fully mission
  capable.
  
  The Hornet is also known for its extreme, slow-speed maneuverability in a dogfight.
  Although incredibly deadly, the Hornet is also a very easy aircraft to fly.
  
  This is the air combat variant."

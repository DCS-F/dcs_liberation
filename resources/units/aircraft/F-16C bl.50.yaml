description:
  "The F-16C is a single seat, single engine multirole fighter that was
  developed in the 1970s. More than 4,500 units were manufactured and are operated
  today by 26 countries where the aircraft performs numerous missions that include
  air superiority, close air support, precision bombing, air defense suppression,
  reconnaissance and more. Few other aircraft can match its versatility, maneuverability,
  firepower, and huge production numbers.


  Nicknamed the Viper by its pilots, the F-16 was designed with a reclined seating
  position for high G tolerance and a single-piece bubble canopy for exceptional visibility
  and comfort. Its lightweight and powerful F-110-GE-129 engines provide a greater
  than 1:1 thrust ratio.


  The F-16C Block 50 is a late version of the F-16C."
